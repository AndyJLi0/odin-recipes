    <p> I love spring rolls. These very very good. Need I say more?
    </p>
    <p>Spring rolls, compained with dumplings, Tang Yuan or Yuan Xiao, and Nian
      Gao, is one of the most popular Chinese New Year dishes. Normally, these
      are served with dimsum. Have fun preparing this amazing traditional dish!

              <li>1 tablespoon of water</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Instructions:</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Marinate pork with all the marinating sauce in a small bowl. Set
          aside for around 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat up around 2 tablespoons of cooking oil in wok, add shredded
          pork in and fry until there is no pink color any more. Transfer
          immediately to avoid overcook since we will deep fry later</li>
        <li>Finely shredded other vegetables. Heat up around Â½ tablespoon oil in
          wok and fry all the other side ingredients until slightly soft.
          Sprinkle pinch of salt and mix well.</li>
        <li>Prepare all the ingredients (fried pork and side ingredients) and
          your spring roll wrappers. Whisk the slurry in a small bowl.
        </li>
        <li>assemble the spring rolls by rolling them :)</li>
        <li>Pre-heat the oil for deep-frying in a small pot or a wok. When the
          oil is ready, place a chopstick in and there will be lots of small
          bubbles around it. Or you can use leftover wrappers for testing. The
          content can float on surface immediately. The oil temperature should
          be around 160 degree C or 320 degree F.</li>
        <li>Slowly slide the spring rolls in and deep fry in small batches. Deep
          fry until the spring rolls become lightly browned</li>
        <li> Heat the oil around2-3 minutes (oil temperature around 190~200
          degree C or 390 degree F )and then place all of the spring rolls in
          and then continue frying for 10 seconds. Watch carefully until the
          they are almost browned.</li>
        <li> And then drain on a paper towel before serving. You can serve along
          with some of your favorite sauces.</li>
